Hi,

I'm A.J. and I'm located in Los Angeles, California. I first got technician licence in 2016 as KM6AKK and upgraded to general two months later. In 2018 I became W6CMY. 

Activities

I'm an active volunteer with the LAFD Aucilliary Communication Service (ACS) as well as ARES Los Angeles Northwest. Both are great organizations to join if you're in the L.A. area and provide ample opportunities to give back to the community, learn and expand your skills, and socialize with other hams.

As I don't have a home station I focus exclusively on portable operations, including Summits on the Air (SOTA) but also finding good spots near my home. Recently I've also embarked on learning "the code" to further all of this.

Videos
I've make the odd video every now and then to put on Youtube:
* Cheap piles out of electrical conduit pipes
* 20m Full Loop Antenna
* SOTA activation of W6/CT-225 Flink Peak, Glendale, California

Resources
This is a collection of bookmarks and similar online resources that I keep updated.
